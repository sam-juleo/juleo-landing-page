We believe that getting to know someone before marrying is a must and that diving into the dating scene with the intention of not settling down may not be that fruitful. The App operates with like-minded Users to find someone they can spend their life with. The App allows Users to find a prospective match that has the same frequency as the one they searched for. The Users on the App will provide their preferences to look for someone compatible, and in any chance of a mutual feeling, the Users can get into a conversation/meet before deciding.</p>} />

Juleo will also undertake criminal verification for the Users to ensure their safety on the App. If the verification measures are completed, then the User profile is verified. The Users will not be able to use the Services in the event any verification checks fail for them. The Users will not be allowed to edit specific information they provide on the App, for example, the name, date of birth and contact details, other than as provided in the <span className="text-blue-700"><a href="/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> </span>.</p>} />
